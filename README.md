##  Problem Statement

Getting a loan is still a slow and paperwork-heavy process. Many loan decisions are biased or unclear, leaving applicants confused.  
For rural and semi-urban users, these problems are even more severe due to limited resources and access.

### Challenges Faced
- Basic smartphones that cannot run heavy applications
- Patchy internet connectivity (2G/3G common)
- Low digital literacy; English-heavy forms are difficult to understand
- Little or no credit history
- Lack of transparency in rejection reasons
- Privacy and fraud risks when sharing sensitive documents

---

##  Thought Process

The system is designed as an **AI-powered underwriting agent** that simplifies loan application and decision-making.  
Users interact with the system using **voice or simple inputs**, while AI handles eligibility checks, document verification, underwriting, and explanations.

The goal is to make loan access:
- Faster
- Transparent
- Inclusive
- Easy to use for low-literacy users
